This repository contains the R code and documentation for the **Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project** under the Data Science Specialization course available in Coursera.

The objective of this project is to use the data [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and carry out the 
following tasks to clean up the data as instructed in the assignment:

1.	Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.	From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The repository contains the following files:

- **readme.Rmd**  : This document

- **run_analysis.R** : The R code that carries out the tasks specified in the assignment. The script requires that the UCI HAR Dataset is extracted and available in the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" of the working directory.

- **TidyData.txt** : The output of the 5th step 

- **code_book.Rmd** : Description of all the variables and summaries calculated, including units
